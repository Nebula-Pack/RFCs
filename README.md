# Nebula Pack RFCs

This repository is for submitting and discussing significant changes or new features for Nebula Pack.

### What is an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a document used to propose changes, new features, or architectural decisions. RFCs go through a review process to get feedback from the community and maintainers before they are accepted and implemented.

### How to Submit an RFC

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `rfc/lua-c-module-support`).
3. **Copy the RFC template** (see `rfcs/0000-template.md`) to a new file and name it `0000-my-proposal.md` (replace "my-proposal" with your title).
4. Fill out the RFC template with your proposal.
5. Submit a **Pull Request** to this repository.

Once a proposal is submitted, the community and maintainers will discuss the RFC. If changes are requested, update the RFC and push the changes. Once there is consensus, the RFC will be merged and considered accepted.

### RFC Statuses

- **Active**: The RFC is being actively reviewed and is close to a decision.
- **Accepted**: The RFC has been accepted and is ready for implementation.
- **Rejected**: The RFC has been declined or wonâ€™t be implemented.
